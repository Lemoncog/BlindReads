Points:

Don't judge the design, i was also playing with Roboguice in this app.
I think the app crashes a lot, thats by design.

RestAdapter - Retrofit class. Provids you with services.

- Can be configured
- Client, does the request I am using a extended OKClient class which performs HTTP requests with some oAuth signing.
- Server, holds url to server, simple model class.
- Convert, turns the response into a model. Default is GSON but I'm using a SimpleXMLConverter as the server gives me XML.

Services - The service the server gives, as in the endpoints.
- The cool bit of Retrofit
- specificy path, paramaters/queries and verb POST/GET
- NO CODE!! WHAT?! HOW!
- Retrofit does it for you!

Service should match RESTful server api like a mirror. Its simples.

-> BookController.java
- So little code.
